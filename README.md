  1. before starting it you have to install datetime module, telegram.ext package and python-telegram-bot package
     for example:
         write into the console -> pip install datetime
                                                         etc...

    WHAT IS IT?
    this is a telegram-bot, that consideres itself as a notebook.
    it creates 4 buttons:
    1 - /make_a_note (adds notes)
    2 - /check_my_notes (shows all notes)
    3 - /delete_the_note (deletes a note by 2 ways: you may type a number of it or write it all)
    4 - /menu (shows all commands, i mentioned before, and shortly informs about them)
    
    all notes are written in a json file.
    
    to be brief, it can add, show and delete notes.
